## Key Features

1. **Alternative Drug Suggestions**:
   - Recommend alternative medications based on active ingredients and user needs.

2. **Drug Information**:
   - Provide detailed drug info, including dosage, side effects, and interactions, using integrated APIs.

3. **Nearby Pharmacies**:
   - Locate nearby pharmacies with real-time drug availability on a map via geolocation.

4. **Symptom-Based Drug Recommendations**:
   - Use AI to suggest possible conditions and medications based on user-input symptoms.

5. **Health History & Prediction**:
   - Predict future health conditions and recommend preventive measures by analyzing uploaded medical history.

## Workflow

1. **Sign-Up & Profile Creation**:
   - Users create an account and provide basic health info (e.g., age, allergies).

2. **Symptom Input & Drug Suggestions**:
   - Users input symptoms; the system suggests conditions and suitable medications.

3. **Drug Search**:
   - Users search for specific drug info to understand dosage, side effects, and interactions.

4. **Nearby Pharmacies**:
   - Geolocation-based service to find nearby pharmacies with real-time drug stock updates.

5. **Health History Upload & Prediction**:
   - Users upload medical reports; AI predicts future health risks and recommends actions.

## Challenges & Mitigation Strategies

### Challenges:
1. **API Failures**:
   - Downtime or inaccurate data from APIs could disrupt features.
2. **AI Inaccuracy**:
   - Incorrect symptom-based recommendations could harm users.
3. **Data Breaches**:
   - Security issues could lead to legal consequences and loss of trust.
4. **Geolocation Failures**:
   - Mapping errors may prevent finding pharmacies.
5. **Drug Unavailability**:
   - Real-time stock data issues could leave users without options.
6. **Medical History Errors**:
   - Misinterpreted health data could lead to incorrect predictions.

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. **Geolocation**:
   - Allow manual pharmacy entry as a fallback.
2. **Drug Unavailability**:
   - Partner with multiple pharmacies and notify users when stock is available.
3. **Medical History**:
   - Implement document parsing and manual review for accuracy.
